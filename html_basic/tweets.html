    <h1>FOREVER YOUNG</h1>
    <p>Forever young
    I want to be forever young
    Do you really want to live forever?
    Forever, and ever
    Forever young
    I want to be forever young
    Do you really want to live forever?
    Forever young</p>

        <h2> Lets dance in style</h2>
        Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
    </p>
    <h3>Let us die young</h3>
    <p>Let us die young or let us live forever
        We don't have the power but we never say never
        Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
        The music's for the sad men</p>

        <p>Can you imagine when this race is won
            Turn our golden faces into the sun
            Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
            The music's played by the, the mad man</p>
