    <p>I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
        I threw the day old tea from the cup
        Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
        Memories of a life that's been loved
        Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
        Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
        Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
        But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
